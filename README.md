# Rainfall-Prediction
The goal is to predict rainfall based on various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and others. The trained model is saved as a .pkl file for deployment and reuse.This project demonstrates a Rainfall Prediction Model built using the Random Forest Algorithm.
